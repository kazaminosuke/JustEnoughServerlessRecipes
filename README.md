It injects a synced fallback recipe map on the client so JEI can still display
the full vanilla recipe set, including smithing recipes and armor trims.

It also lets JEI's existing recipe transfer button fill supported vanilla menus even when the server does not have JEI.

## <span style="color:#8000ff;">$\large\color{green}{\textsf{Description}}$</span>
This mod is for the common case where:

- the player has JEI installed on the client
- the server does not have JEI installed
- JEI normally opens with missing recipe categories or no usable recipe view

`Just Enough Serverless Recipes` fixes that by supplying JEI with a client-side fallback recipe map.

It currently:

- restores vanilla recipe viewing on servers without server-side JEI
- restores JEI recipe transfer on supported vanilla menus without server-side JEI
- injects the fallback early enough to avoid JEI starting with an empty recipe sync
- supports the full bundled vanilla `26.1` recipe set
- includes smithing transform and smithing trim recipes
- uses the integrated server recipe manager automatically in singleplayer

---

## <span style="color:#8000ff;">$\large\color{green}{\textsf{How It Works}}$</span>
- In singleplayer, the mod reads recipes from the integrated server directly.
- In multiplayer, it injects a bundled vanilla fallback recipe dataset before JEI finishes starting.
- For recipe transfer, it keeps JEI's existing button and swaps the backend to vanilla container clicks when JEI is missing server-side.
- If a server already provides a proper synced recipe map, the mod stays out of the way.

This keeps JEI usable without requiring JEI on the server.

---

## <span style="color:#8000ff;">$\large\color{green}{\textsf{Requirements}}$</span>
- JEI is required on the client.

---

## <span style="color:#8000ff;">$\large\color{green}{\textsf{Installation}}$</span>
1. Choose the matching `Fabric` or `NeoForge` build.
2. Install the required loader for that build.
3. For Fabric, also install Fabric API.
4. Install the matching JEI build on the client.
5. Install `Just Enough Serverless Recipes` on the client.
6. Launch the game and join a server without JEI installed server-side.

## <span style="color:#8000ff;">$\large\color{green}{\textsf{Notes}}$</span>
- This is a client-side mod.
- The server does not need to install this mod.
- The server does not need to install JEI.
- The player still needs JEI installed locally, because this mod extends JEI rather than replacing it.
